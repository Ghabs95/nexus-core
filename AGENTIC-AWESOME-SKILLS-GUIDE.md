# Agentic Awesome Skills Guide

> **Credit & Upstream Repository**: The [sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/) repository is the central authority on these skills. If you find these skills useful for your workflows, please consider staring their repository or supporting the project.

This guide explains how to install and use their massive collection of 900+ curated, high-performance agentic skills seamlessly within an existing multi-agent ecosystem across various AI coding assistants (Antigravity, Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.).

## 1. Installation Strategies

You don't need to replace your custom agents. The awesome skills can work *alongside* them.

### Option A: Global Installation (Recommended)
This installs all 900+ skills globally on your machine. Your chosen AI assistant will load these in addition to the project-specific agents.

```bash
# Default (Antigravity)
npx antigravity-awesome-skills

# Cursor
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --cursor

# Claude Code
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --claude

# Gemini CLI
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --gemini
```

### Option B: Cherry-Picking Skills (Workspace Installation)
If you only want specific skills or want to commit them to the repository for the entire team:
1. Browse the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/tree/main/skills).
2. Copy the desired skill folder.
3. Paste it into your project's local skills directory (e.g., `.agent/skills/` for Antigravity, `.cursor/skills/` for Cursor, `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code).

## 2. Finding the Right Skills (Bundles)

The repository uses **Bundles** to help you find skills relevant to your role. **Bundles are not separate installations.** They are just curated lists of recommended skills.

Check the [Bundles Documentation](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/BUNDLES.md) to find packs like:
- **Essentials** (5 skills everyone needs, e.g., `@brainstorming`, `@lint-and-validate`)
- **Web Wizard** (Frontend specific skills)
- **Security Developer** (Auditing and hardening skills)

## 3. How to Use Skills

Once installed (either globally or locally), you invoke a skill by simply mentioning its name in your prompt to the AI.

### Basic Syntax
Just use `@skill-name` in your natural language prompt.

> "Use `@brainstorming` to help me design the new authentication flow."
> "Run `@lint-and-validate` on `examples/app/lib/main.dart`."

**In the Antigravity IDE (Agent Mode):**
```bash
Use @brainstorming to plan this feature
```

**In Cursor:**
```bash
@brainstorming help me design a new feature
```

**In Claude Code / Gemini CLI:**
```bash
Use the @brainstorming skill to help me plan my app
```

### Combining Skills & Custom Agents
Your custom agents (like a `@TechLead` or `@Developer`) act as specialized personas. You can ask a custom agent to use a specific technical skill from the awesome-skills repo!

**Example:**
> "@TechLead, use the `@flutter-expert` and `@testing-patterns` skills to write unit tests for the login screen."

**Example Chaining:**
> "@BackendLead, use `@brainstorming` to design the new API endpoint, then apply `@api-security-best-practices` to ensure it's secure."

## 4. Best Practices

- **Be Specific:** Always mention the skill and the file/context it should apply to. 
  *(Good: "Use @lint-and-validate to check `examples/src/components/Button.tsx`")*
- **Start with Planning:** Use `@brainstorming` or `@writing-plans` before diving into code.
- **Synthesize:** If a skill from the repo perfectly matches one of your custom agents, consider copying its `SKILL.md` instructions and merging them into the agent's definition to make your agents even smarter.
