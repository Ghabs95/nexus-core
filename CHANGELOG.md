## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **YAML Workflow Orchestration** — Introduced `YamlWorkflowLoader` for loading and validating workflow definitions from YAML. This enables complex multi-step AI workflows with support for parallel execution, conditional branching, and retry policies ([#62](https://github.com/Ghabs95/nexus-core/issues/62)).
- **Schema Validation** — `YamlWorkflowLoader` performs comprehensive schema validation before instantiation, ensuring `agent_type`, `retry_policy`, and `parallel` groups are correctly defined.
- **Retry Policies in YAML** — Workflow steps can now define a `retry_policy` block in YAML, supporting `max_retries`, `backoff` strategy (exponential, linear, constant), and `initial_delay`.
- **Parallel Step Execution Foundation** — Added `parallel` field to YAML step definitions and `WorkflowStep.parallel_with` to the core model. Introduced `WorkflowEngine.get_runnable_steps()` to identify steps that can be executed concurrently.
- **Enhanced YAML Loading** — `YamlWorkflowLoader` exported via `nexus.core` for a cleaner public API. Support for `strict` mode to promote schema warnings to errors during loading.

### Changed
- `WorkflowDefinition.from_dict()` now parses `retry_policy.max_retries` from YAML into `WorkflowStep.retry`, while maintaining backward compatibility for explicit `retry` integer fields.
- `WorkflowStep` model updated with `parallel_with: List[str]` field to track concurrent execution dependencies.

### Security
- **Safe YAML Loading** — All YAML loading now exclusively uses `yaml.safe_load()` to prevent arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities from untrusted YAML content.
