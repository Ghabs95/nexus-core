# Example Project Configuration for Nexus with nexus-core Framework
#
# This file demonstrates how to configure multiple projects with the nexus bot,
# showing global defaults, per-project overrides, and how to customize workflows
# for different teams/projects.

# --- GLOBAL CONFIGURATION ---
# These settings apply to all projects unless overridden per-project

# Global workflow definition path (YAML workflow file - single source of truth)
# All workflow chains, routing logic, and agent orchestration are defined in this file
# See the workflow YAML for full step definitions, conditional routing, and approval gates
# Relative paths are resolved from BASE_DIR environment variable
workflow_definition_path: your-org/workflows/your_org_workflow.yaml

# VCS-agnostic inbox/tasks directory (can be .nexus, .gitlab, .gitea, etc.)
# Relative to project workspace root
# This allows the system to work with any VCS platform by changing a single config value
nexus_dir: .nexus

# PR Merge Policy (project-level enforcement)
# Controls whether @OpsCommander can auto-merge PRs or must wait for human approval
# Options:
#   - always: Human approval REQUIRED for all PRs (overrides workflow settings)
#   - workflow-based: Workflow YAML controls per-workflow/per-step merge behavior
#   - never: Auto-merge allowed (NOT recommended for production)
require_human_merge_approval: workflow-based  # Overrideable per project

# GitHub Issue Triage Configuration (optional)
# Maps incoming GitHub issues to agent types based on labels and repository
#
# Agent types are abstract roles that workflows implement:
#   - triage: Initial issue analysis and classification
#   - escalation: High-priority/urgent issues (escalate to senior agent)
#   - debug: Bug analysis and root cause analysis
#
# Each project's workflow defines which actual agent implements each type.
issue_triage:
  # Default agent type for issues with no matching labels
  default_agent_type: "triage"
  
  # Per-repository override (use different agent type for specific repos)
  per_repo:
    # "your-org/important-repo": "escalation"  # All issues in this repo → escalation
  
  # Label-based routing to agent types
  label_based:
    "triage": "triage"              # Triage workflow
    "good first issue": "triage"    # Beginner-friendly → triage
    "bug": "debug"                   # Bugs → debug agent
    "urgent": "escalation"          # Urgent → escalation agent
    "critical": "escalation"        # Critical → escalation agent
    # "enhancement": "design"       # Features → design agent (optional)

# Global AI tool preferences: which AI tool to use for each AGENT TYPE
# Options: copilot (GitHub Copilot), gemini (Google Gemini), codex (OpenAI Codex CLI)
#
# IMPORTANT: This maps AGENT TYPES (system roles) to AI tools, not individual agents
# - Agent types are defined in agent YAML files with `agent_type` field
# - Multiple agents can have the same type (e.g., two @triage agents for fallback)
# - Tasks are routed to agent types, not specific agents
# - The first available agent of that type handles the task
#
# Example agent YAML:
#   spec:
#     agent_type: "triage"       # This agent is a triage agent
#     provider_preference: null  # Can be overridden by ai_tool_preferences
ai_tool_preferences:
  # ===== SYSTEM AGENT TYPES (abstract roles used by workflows) =====
  # These types are used by:
  # - issue_triage config (routes issues to agent types)
  # - workflow YAML (assigns work to agent types)
  # - task assignment (looks for agents with matching system_type)
  
  triage: copilot          # Issue classification and analysis
  designer: copilot        # Design and architecture proposals
  debug: copilot           # Root cause analysis
  reviewer: copilot        # PR reviews and code quality
  developer: copilot       # Code implementation
  docs: gemini             # Documentation updates (faster)
  summarizer: gemini       # Workflow summaries (faster)
  escalation: copilot      # High-priority escalation to senior agent

# --- PROJECT CONFIGURATIONS ---
# Each project must have: agents_dir, workspace
# Recommended: git_repo (primary). Optional: git_repos for multi-repo projects.
# Optional: workflow_definition_path, ai_tool_preferences
# Paths (agents_dir, workspace, workflow_definition_path) can be relative to BASE_DIR

# Example: Project A (uses global defaults)
project_a:
  agents_dir: project-a/agents
  workspace: project_a
  git_repo: acme/project-a

# Example: Project B (uses global defaults)
project_b:
  agents_dir: project-b/agents
  workspace: project_b
  git_repo: acme/project-b

# Example: Project C (uses global defaults)
project_c:
  agents_dir: project-c/agents
  workspace: project_c
  git_repo: acme/project-c

# Example: Custom Project (CUSTOM AI TOOLS - OVERRIDES global defaults)
# This shows how to customize AI tool preferences for specific agents
custom_project:
  agents_dir: custom-project/agents
  workspace: custom_project
  git_repo: acme/custom-project
  
  # Use a different workflow YAML file for this project  
  # (defaults to global workflow_definition_path if not specified)
  # Can be relative (to BASE_DIR) or absolute path
  workflow_definition_path: custom-project/workflows/custom_workflow.yaml
  
  # Custom AI tool preferences for this project's agents
  # Map agent_type (from workflow YAML) to AI tool (copilot/gemini/codex)
  # Only list agents that differ from global defaults
  ai_tool_preferences:
    triage: copilot          # Triage agent - issue classification
    designer: copilot        # Designer agent - technical proposals  
    debug: copilot           # Debug agent - root cause analysis
    reviewer: copilot        # Reviewer agent - PR reviews
    developer: copilot       # Developer agent - code implementation
    docs: gemini             # Docs agent - documentation updates (faster)
    summarizer: gemini       # Summarizer agent - workflow summaries (faster)
    OpsCommander: gemini     # Deployment agent (if using Ghabs org agents)
