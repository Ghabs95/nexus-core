# PR Merge Policy (project-level enforcement)
# Controls whether @deployer can auto-merge PRs or must wait for human approval
# Options:
#   - always: Human approval REQUIRED for all PRs (overrides workflow settings)

#   - never: Auto-merge allowed (NOT recommended for production)

# GitHub Issue Triage Configuration
# Maps incoming GitHub issues to agent types (not specific agents)
# 
# Agent types are abstract roles that workflows implement:
#   - triage: Initial issue analysis and classification
#   - escalation: High-priority/urgent issues (escalate to senior agent)
#   - debug: Bug analysis and root cause
#
# Each project's workflow defines which actual agent implements each type.
# Example:
#   - nexus uses enterprise_workflow.yaml: triage → @triage, escalation → @triage (with priority flag)
github_issue_triage:
  # Default agent type when no specific mapping applies
  # Routes to whatever agent is configured for this type in the current workflow
  default_agent_type: "triage"
  
  # Per-repository agent type override (if different from default)
  per_repo:
    "Ghabs95/nexus-core": "triage" # Nexus core issues use triage workflow

  # Label-based routing to agent types
  label_based:
    "docs": "triage"              # Documentation issues → triage agent
    "good first issue": "triage"  # Beginner issues → triage agent
    "bug": "debug"                # Bugs → debug agent (root cause analysis)
    "urgent": "escalation"        # Urgent → escalation agent (senior review)
    "critical": "escalation"      # Critical → escalation agent

# Global AI tool preferences (which AI tool each AGENT TYPE uses)
# Maps AGENT TYPES (not individual agents) to AI providers
#
# Architecture:
# 1. Agent YAML files define: spec.agent_type (e.g., "triage", "debug", "escalation")
# 2. Tasks are routed to agent types (not specific agent names)
# 3. The first available agent with that type handles the task
# 4. This config maps type → AI tool, so all agents of that type use the same tool
#
# Example agent YAML:
#   spec:
#     agent_type: "triage"       # This agent handles type: triage
#     provider_preference: null  # Will use value from ai_tool_preferences
